This SMS and IM application connects BreweryMap/BreweryDB data through the
Tropo service using PHP.

To try out this service, send a Jabber IM to brewerymap@tropo.im or send a text
message to 919-701-BREW (2739).

=========================
GETTING STARTED
=========================

1:  ACQUIRE AN API KEY FROM BREWERYDB.COM

    Go to http://www.brewerydb.com/api/ and request a key.  Once you have been
    granted your key, you need to put your key in the correct location within
    the BreweryMap-tropo.php file.  This is done by setting the
    BREWERYDB_APIKEY constant around line 63.


2:  ACQUIRE AN API KEY FROM DEVELOPER.YAHOO.COM

    Go to http://developer.yahoo.com and request an API key with access to the
    geo-location service.  Once you get your key, you need to set the
    YAHOO_APIKEY constant around line 68.


3:  CREATE A HOSTED APPLICATION AT TROPO.COM

    This Tropo app was created as a hosted application.  To get started, go to
    http://www.tropo.com and signup for a free account.  You can create your own
    BreweryMap application from your dashboard there.


4:  UPLOAD YOUR CODE

    Upload this code, along with your specific API keys, to your tropo
    application.  You should now be able to run it and get back results!
